# Educational Technology Plan

The purpose of this Educational Technology Plan is to identify the major hardware and software requirements, describe the network, and analyze the software necessary for the Intro to Computer Science Course.

## Context

### Course

Enrichment: Intro to Computer Science
The course offered to students will be an enrichment/elective style course as we don't currently offer Computer Science and are only able to fit the course in as an elective. Students currently take 2 ELA classes, a math class, a science class, a social studies class, PE 2 days a week with an enrichment class the alternating 2 days, and a music appreciation class on Mondays. The enrichment class used to be offered where students could choose their elective based on interest however with the new Student Information System the school adopted, we are no longer able to offer elective choices and all students are kept with one class the entire year for their elective. As such, I am thinking I will be able to offer an Intro to Computer Science with the class at the beginning of the year for all students, and then make an extension to the Introduction course, where some students will complete the next level computer science course while the other students have an alternative choice for their enrichment at that time.
Grade Level: 7th and 8th Grade

### Situation

We are a K-8th grade school that is a one school school district. We have a total of 570 students on our campus with over 120 students in the junior high (7th and 8th grades). Currently we offer chromebooks at a 1:1 ratio in the junior high, where students are able to "check out" a chromebook for the day which they then return at the end of the day. Students are not able to take chromebooks home, therefore not all students have access to technology outside of the classroom, but at least when in the classroom all students have access. Most students have the same model of chromebook, however as the computers are damaged and traded in, sometimes students will get a "newer" model and it won't be the same as the rest of the students in the class.

## Plan

### Software Specifications

Describe the software that you will use. Include software used for students as
well as any software the instructor will use. This should include any software
installed as well as any online services.

### Hardware Specifications

Describe the hardware requirements for your class. Provide specific requirements
wherever necessary.

### Application

Describe how you will use the above technologies in the class, including
in-class activities, homework, assignments, and assessment. Justify the use
in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, evidence-based and inclusive pedagogy.

### Impacts

How will the technology help *all* students learn? In this section, you can also
describe how you address class resiliency, such as adapting to
transitions to virtual education, social/legal/ethical challenges,  and/or
evolving course contexts.
