# Educational Technology Plan

The purpose of this Educational Technology Plan is to identify the major hardware requirements, describe the network, and analyze the software necessary for the Intro to Computer Science Course offered to 7th and 8th grade students at Pacific Union Elementary School in Arcata, CA.

## Context

### Course

Enrichment: Intro to Computer Science

This course introduces the concepts and language of computer science. Students will learn the binary number system including how to convert from base 10 to base 2 and arithmetic that is necessary for the beginning concepts of computer science. Students will begin designing and writing code, as well as creating a game for their final project.

Grade Level: 7th and 8th Grade

### Situation

We are a K-8th grade school that is a one school school district, which gives us a little more freedom with the technology choices as we don't have multiple sites to consider. We have a total of 570 students on our campus with over 120 students in the junior high (7th and 8th grades). Currently we offer chromebooks at a 1:1 ratio in the junior high, where students are able to "check out" a chromebook for the day which they then return at the end of the day. Students are not able to take chromebooks home, therefore not all students have access to technology outside of the classroom, but at least when in the classroom all students have access to both a computer and relatively high speed internet. Most students have the same model of chromebook, however as the computers are damaged and traded in, sometimes students will get a different model and it won't be the same as the rest of the students in the class, but they all are chromebooks with the same operating system.

The network at our school has multiple wireless hubs in each of the wings that allow for internet access anywhere on campus. There is a firewall set up to limit student access to certain websites, including video and shopping websites just to name a few. I am hoping the firewall won't be an issue with the coding I hope to have students doing, but I haven't tested the scratch or replit websites to ensure they are accessible.

The course offered to students will be an enrichment/elective style course as we don't currently offer Computer Science and are only able to fit the course in as an elective. Students currently take 2 ELA classes, a math class, a science class, a social studies class, PE 2 days a week with an enrichment class the alternating 2 days, and a music appreciation class on Mondays.  With this schedule, the enrichment class will be 45-50 minutes 2 days a week. The school year is separated into trimesters, with 3 grading periods that are about 12 weeks long. Therefore, this enrichment course needs to be formatted for 24 sessions (2 days each for 12 weeks) each being 45 minutes long (after attendance, etc.). Most classes are between 24-30 students.

The enrichment class used to be offered where students could choose their elective based on interest, however with the new Student Information System the school adopted, we are no longer able to offer elective choices and all students are kept with one class the entire year for their elective. As such, I am thinking I will be able to offer an Intro to Computer Science with the entire class at the beginning of the year during the first 12 week grading period. The second `12 week grading period, I hope to offer an extension to the introductory course, where some students will complete the next level computer science course during the next 12 weeks while the other students have an alternative choice for their enrichment in the same class period.

## Plan

### Software Specifications

All students have chromebooks so they will have ChromeOS software. Our students are all given a google account that is used to log them in to multiple apps on the chromebook including all of the google suite apps and an email account. The student email accounts are set-up to only accept email from accounts on our network, so they are not able to get email from outside sources. I am not sure how that will work when they need to set up accounts for replit or scratch (both online interfaces I hope to use with students) - if they need a confirmation email or code to start an account, that could complicate things.  For most accounts that we ask our students to use, they are pre set-up for them and they usually only need to log in with their google account. Maybe that is an option for replit or scratch? 
The Student Interface System that we will use for attendance and grading purposes is Infinite Campus (IC) and the students will have access to an IC account in order to keep track of grades and assignments.

The teacher will use the MacOS software installed on the school laptop. The smartTV with screen share will be used instead of a projector, so presentations and examples can be shared whole group.  Google Classroom will be used to share assignments and any presentations/materials so students can have access at any time. Also, IC has the capability to work with Google Classroom so grades and assignments don't have to be entered in twice, they carry over to IC from Google Classroom - while we do not have this feature currently, if we could purchase it, I think it could streamline tracking assignments and grades for both students and teachers. The teacher will also use scratch and replit to show example coding and get students started with assignments.


### Hardware Specifications

Students will need chromebooks able to run the most recent ChromeOS update. (I will have to check what that is...)

Teacher will need MacBook Air - M1 2020, Apple M1 Chip, 16 GB Memory, 500 GB Flash Storage

### Application

Describe how you will use the above technologies in the class, including
in-class activities, homework, assignments, and assessment. Justify the use
in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, evidence-based and inclusive pedagogy.

-The first 2 weeks of the 12 week course will be spent introducing the basics of computer science, including what hardware and software is, and the requirements necessary for the operating systems that our students use and what they might want to look for when purchasing their own computers.

-The next 2 weeks, students will learn the binary number system and how to convert from base 10 to base 2. There will be a worksheet for students to complete with partners on day 7 and then we will correct in class on day 8 for immediate feedback for students.

-The following 2 weeks will be introducing students to scratch and completing their first scratch project - getting a sprite to bounce off the walls without using the bounce feature. 
This will ensure students can start the sprite moving, set boundaries for the sprite's movement, as well as bouncing the sprite off the walls without having the sprite's movement stop.

-The next two weeks will have the students creating a 'falling' game, much like we did in our CSED 500 class this last summer. It was a great way to learn how to repeat the movement of the sprite and learn how to add mulitple sprites. I know I will have some students who will take longer than others, so I will have an additional assignment for students who finish the 'falling' game with time to spare. I also want students to work together for this one. I think the pair programming would work really well for this assignment as students can have the support of an extra set of eyes while still being responsible for their own work. Plus, it gives them time to practice with another student before they get to work on their final project.

-The last 4 weeks of class will have the students working on their final projects for Intro to Computer Science. I want students to create a game based on "frogger", again like we did in our CSED 500 class this summer. It was a great way to learn the "while" function and I think it provides enough space for students to really learn how to develop and write the functions for multiple sprites with movement, boundaries, and even adding functions including a score.

I plan to have the first day of each 2 week mini-unit be an introductory day, with the concepts being presented whole group. If there is time, I hope to have students actively learning, google forms to survey students with an exit ticket, as well as worksheets and other online assignments to keep students focused and involved.  Days 2-4 in the mini-units are going to be work days with problets that either are auto-graded or are graded whole class so students have immediate feedback.  I will enter grades in Infinite Campus every other week, one participation grade and one assignment grade so students are aware of their progress in the course.



### Impacts

How will the technology help *all* students learn? In this section, you can also
describe how you address class resiliency, such as adapting to
transitions to virtual education, social/legal/ethical challenges,  and/or
evolving course contexts.
